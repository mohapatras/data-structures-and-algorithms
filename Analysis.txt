Worst case Big O approximations

Reading file is common for all the tasks.
Time complexity:
O(n) -> Reading text.csv 
O(n) -> Reading calls.csv

Task0.py
O(1) -> For iterations.


Task1.py

Two explicit for nested loops.

O(log n) for first for loop.
O(n) for second for loop.

Hence, O(n+logn)

Task1.py

O(n) -> Single explicit for loop.
O(1) -> for rest 3 lines inside for loop.

Task2.py
O(n) -> for single list comprehension.

Task3.py
Part-A

O(n) -> For first list comprehension.
O(n) -> For second list comprehension.
O(n) -> For third for loop comprehension.
O(logn) -> For sorting the list.

Hence, in case of the third loop comprehension, total analysis is O(n*logn)

Part-B
O(n) -> For the single list comprehension.
O(1) -> Constant operation for rest of the line of codes in this section.

Task4.py
total 3 explicit for loops.
O(n) -> For first for loop
O(n) -> For second for loop
O(n) -> For third for loop
O(logn) -> for sorting of the list.
